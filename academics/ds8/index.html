<p>This introductory course in data science is built on three interrelated perspectives: inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world relevance. Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that data so as to understand that phenomenon? How does one collect data to answer questions that one is interested in? Inferential thinking refers to an ability to connect data to underlying phenomena and to the ability to think critically about the conclusions that are drawn from data analysis. Computational thinking refers to the ability to conceive of the abstractions and processes that allow inferential procedures to be embodied in computer programs, and to ensure that such programs are scalable, robust and understandable. In addition to teaching critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference, the course will involve the hands-on analysis of a variety of real-world datasets, including economic data, document collections, geographical data and social networks, and it will delve into social and legal issues surrounding data analysis, including issues of privacy and data ownership. </p>
